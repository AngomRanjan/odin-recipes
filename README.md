# Odin-Recipe Project
My first HTML project as a part of Microverse Precourse.
Here I have learnt to set up my project in GitHub Repo and how to clone it to my localmachine.
This Recipe Project consist of a main HomePage which link to 3 different recipe pages.
Each recipe pages has a main Recipe Heading followed by an Image of the finish recipe.
Below the Image is a "Description" Heading under which a paragraph or two about the recipe is describe.
Then follows the "Ingredients" heading under which the ingredients are listed inside an unordered list.
Then Steps of preparation are listed in an ordered list under the heading "Steps"
finally the finished project is push to GitHub
