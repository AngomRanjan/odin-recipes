       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>A recipe for roasted chicken. I never have had a chicken this juicy before; this little trick works and makes the people eating it go silent. It's funny. We nibble on the celery after.</p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
           <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
           <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
           <li>Â½ cup margarine, divided</li>
           <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
         </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
           <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
           <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.</li>
