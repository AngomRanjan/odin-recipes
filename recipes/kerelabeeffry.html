       <h3>Description</h3>
       <p>Kerala Beef Fry is one of my favorite South Indian delicacies.  It is a stir fry of beef with variety of Indian spices, coconut oil, coconut slices and a plenty of curry leaves.</p>
       <p>Kerala beef fry is most commonly eaten with kerala porotta, whereas in some parts such as Thrippunithura, the dish has been combined with pazham pori and has become a very popular combo in the region.</p>

       <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
           <li>Cook the beef in a pressure cooker with salt, pepper powder, meat masala, and a little water. Pressure cook for 2 whistles and then remove the cooker from the flame. Allow it to rest until the pressure goes off. Keep aside.</li>
           <li>Heat the coconut oil in a pan and splutter mustard seeds. Add curry leaves, sliced shallots, green chilies, and a little salt. Saute until the onions turn translucent.</li>
           <li>Add ginger garlic paste, saute for a minute until the smell resides.</li>
           <li>Add spice powders; chili, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and mix well. Make sure to turn the heat to a low while adding the spice powders, so that it does not burn.</li>
           <li>Remove the lid from the pressure cooker and transfer the cooked beef with the remaining water to the pan, mix well with the masala and cook on a medium flame until the gravy dries out. Stir the gravy occasionally while cooking, to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add salt as needed.</li>           
           <li>Meanwhile, heat a little oil in another pan and fry the coconut bites. As it starts to brown, add curry leaves and fry it along with the coconut bites until browned. Keep aside.</li>
           <li>When the gravy dries out, reduce the flame to a low and saute the beef in the pan for 10-15 minutes. Add the fried curry leaves and coconut bites, and mix well together. Scrape the sides of the pan, toss until the meat is brown -black and dried out completely.</li>
           <li>Serve hot with Rice, Porotta, Appam, Naan, or any other bread.</li>
